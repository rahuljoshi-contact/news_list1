Testing
- all basic flows are working.
- tested on many browsers available to ensure working and ui rendering

To-do
====================
back-end:
- more validations on the back-end
- unit tests to ensure API working (was researching on unit test framework, didn't get much opportunity)

front-end:
- more validation on front-end
- front end component tests (installed jest and played around, couldn't finish)
- refactoring code on front-end for model separation, optimizations, state updates.
- more polish on the code, re-arrangement, comments

UI/UX
- responsive design to optimize for big and small screens.
- wanted to do a 'popup form' but wasn't sure exactly how to get it
